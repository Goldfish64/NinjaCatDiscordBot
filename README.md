# Ninja Cat: a Windows Insider build bot for Discord
Ninja Cat is a [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) bot designed to send a messages when a new [Windows 10 Insider](https://insider.windows.com/) build is posted. Simple as that.

Currently it responds to commands beginning with **$ninjacat** or **$nj**, but it will respond to more natural-type queries, thanks to its advanced cat language programming.

Commands:
* **$ninjacat-about** or **$nj-about**: shows the bot's about message. :cat:
* **$ninjacat-help** or **$nj-help**: shows the bot's help. :question:
* **$ninjacat-ping** or **$nj-ping**: pong. :ping_pong:
* **$ninjacat-trex** or **$nj-trex**: shows the Windows 10 Skype emoticon. :gift:
* **$ninjacat-latestbuild** or **$nj-latestbuild**: gets the latest Insider build. :mailbox_with_mail:
* **$ninjacat-time** or **$nj-time**: shows the current time. :alarm_clock:
* **$ninjacat-platform** or **$nj-platform**: shows the platform the bot is running on. :house:
