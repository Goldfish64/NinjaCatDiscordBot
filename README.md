# Ninja Cat: a Windows Insider build bot for Discord
Hi there! I am Ninja Cat, a [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) bot designed to alert the channel when a new [Windows 10 Insider](https://insider.windows.com/) build is posted. Simple as that.

Currently I respond to commands beginning with **$nj-**, but I will respond to more natural-type queries, thanks to my advanced cat language programming.

### [Click here to invite me to your server!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?permissions=0&client_id=232369430456172545&scope=bot) ###
